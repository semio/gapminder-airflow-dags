Installation:
1. Copy (or link) the .service files to /etc/systemd/system/
2. Copy airflow.conf to /etc/tmpfiles.d/ (ensures /run/airflow is created with correct permissions)
3. Copy the "airflow" file to /etc/default/airflow and adjust as needed

Usage:
- Start services: systemctl start <service>
- Enable on boot: systemctl enable <service>
- Check status: systemctl status <service>
