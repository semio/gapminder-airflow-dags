These systemd files are configured for Ubuntu with the following setup:
- User: airflow
- Venv: /home/airflow/venv/
- Environment file: /etc/default/airflow

Installation:
1. Copy (or link) the .service files to /etc/systemd/system/
2. Copy airflow.conf to /etc/tmpfiles.d/ (ensures /run/airflow is created with correct permissions)
3. Configure environment variables (choose one):
   - Put them in /etc/default/airflow (see "airflow" template file), OR
   - Put them in /home/airflow/.profile (services use login shell to load it)

The services use `bash -l` (login shell) which loads .profile automatically.
This is useful for nvm-managed node or other user-specific PATH settings.

Usage:
- Start services: systemctl start <service>
- Enable on boot: systemctl enable <service>
- Check status: systemctl status <service>
- View logs: journalctl -u <service> -f

Services (Airflow 3.x):
- airflow-api.service (web UI + API, replaces webserver)
- airflow-scheduler.service
- airflow-triggerer.service (for deferrable operators)

Based on Apache Airflow systemd scripts from commit 53ea85e234b4b4dee6c51e1d79edd84c544bee79
